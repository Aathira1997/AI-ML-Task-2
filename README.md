# Exploratory Data Analysis - Titanic Dataset

## Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to uncover insights, identify trends, visualize distributions, and understand relationships between features such as age, fare, survival, and class.

## Key Components
- **Summary Statistics**: Basic descriptive statistics of numerical features.
  
- **Histograms**:
  - Age distribution
  - Fare distribution

- **Boxplots**:
  - Age by survival status
  - Fare by passenger class

- **Correlation Matrix**: Heatmap of pairwise correlation between numeric variables.

- **Pairplot**: Scatterplot matrix to visualize feature interactions.

## Insights from Visualizations
- Age and fare show right-skewed distributions.
- Younger and older passengers had varied survival probabilities.
- First-class passengers generally paid higher fares and had higher survival rates.
- Positive correlation exists between fare and passenger class, while age has low correlation with other variables.

## Tools Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `Task_2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to reproduce the EDA process and visualizations.
